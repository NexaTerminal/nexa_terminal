# üîí Security Architecture & Implementation

## Current Structure

### Overview
The Nexa Terminal security architecture implements comprehensive security measures across authentication, authorization, data protection, and system hardening to ensure enterprise-level security standards.

### Architecture

#### **Authentication Security**
- **Password Security**: `bcrypt` hashing with salt rounds
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token generation and validation
- **Session Management**: Context-based authentication state
- **Login Protection**: Basic rate limiting considerations

#### **Authorization Framework**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Guest users (public access)
  - Registered users (basic features)
  - Verified companies (premium features)
  - Admin users (system administration)

- **Middleware Protection**:
  - `server/middleware/auth.js` - JWT verification
  - `server/middleware/verificationMiddleware.js` - Company verification
  - Route-level protection for sensitive endpoints

#### **Data Protection**
- **Database Security**:
  - MongoDB connection string protection
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Schema validation and sanitization

- **API Security**:
  - Request validation
  - Input sanitization
  - JSON parsing protection

### Current Security Status

| Security Layer | Status | Implementation |
|----------------|--------|----------------|
| **Authentication** | ‚úÖ Active | bcrypt + JWT tokens |
| **Authorization** | ‚úÖ Active | Role-based middleware |
| **Data Encryption** | üîÑ Partial | Transit encryption only |
| **Input Validation** | ‚úÖ Active | Schema validation |
| **Rate Limiting** | ‚ùå Missing | Not implemented |
| **CSRF Protection** | ‚ùå Missing | Not implemented |
| **XSS Protection** | üîÑ Partial | Basic input sanitization |
| **SQL Injection** | ‚úÖ Protected | MongoDB + validation |
