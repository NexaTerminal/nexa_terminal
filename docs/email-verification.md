The email verification system ensures that companies provide valid business email addresses and complete the verification process to access premium features.

### Architecture

#### **Backend Components**
- **Service**: `server/services/emailService.js`
  - Resend API integration

- **Routes**: `server/routes/verification.js`
  - `POST /send-verification-email` - Send verification email
  - `GET /verify-email` - Process verification link
  - `POST /resend-verification` - Resend verification email

- **Middleware**: `server/middleware/verificationMiddleware.js`
  - `requireVerifiedCompany` - Blocks unverified users from premium features

   ```

3. **Access Control**
   ```

   ```

### Email Service Configuration
